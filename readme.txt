# JavaScript Practice Projects

This repository contains **9 small JavaScript projects** that I built while learning JavaScript and practicing my coding skills.  

I followed the amazing tutorials and guidance from the **Chai aur Code** YouTube channel, which helped me understand the concepts of JavaScript and React better.  

These projects helped me strengthen my JS logic and problem-solving ability.  

Feel free to check them out, explore the code, and share feedback!
